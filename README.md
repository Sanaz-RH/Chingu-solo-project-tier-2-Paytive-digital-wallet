# Chingu-solo-project-tier-2-Paytive-digital-wallet

My most complex web design project was "Paytive," a responsive web application in the fintech industry.  I played the roles of UX researcher, and UX and UI designer for the seven-month, part-time project. The goal was to create a secure, convenient, and efficient digital payment platform, offering features such as transaction tracking and budgeting tools.

The project involved extensive user research, including competitive analysis and user interviews, to understand the market and user needs. Key findings revealed a demand for a user-friendly application with simplified language, transaction categorization, and trust-building measures for a new app.

I created user personas, user flows, and wireframes to map out the design. Through low-, mid-, and high-fidelity prototypes, usability testing was conducted to gather user feedback and identify usability issues. These findings led to design iterations, focusing on issues like typos, color consistency, and icon clarity.

The final design featured an informative onboarding process, a clear overview, and key features like sending and receiving money, viewing recent transactions, splitting bills, and setting budget goals.

This project was challenging, requiring a comprehensive understanding of user needs, adherence to accessibility standards, and the integration of user feedback. It reinforced the importance of user-centric design and provided valuable insights into creating a positive user experience.
